# 👋 Hi, I’m Fahad Noor

I'm a full-stack developer with a strong focus on backend engineering and Gen AI. I specialize in building scalable APIs and robust backend using Django, FastAPI, Node.js, and Express. Alongside this, I’ve delivered production-ready solutions using Generative AI — integrating LLMs for task automation, agentic workflows, conversational agents, voice assistants, and RAG pipelines.

I focus on writing clean, maintainable code and designing backend systems that scale. By combining solid software engineering principles with modern AI capabilities, I deliver solutions that are scalable, maintainable and production-ready.
